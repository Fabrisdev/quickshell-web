Quickshell is a toolkit for building a desktop shell, which is to say components
of your desktop like bars, widgets, lock screens, display managers, and the like.

Quickshell is based on QtQuick and configured with QML, the QtQuick interface
description language. It provides integrations for common shell functionality,
as well as support for hot reloading and tools to work with processes,
sockets, files, and more.

Built-in integrations are currently provided for:
- Wayland and X11 for windowing
- Wayland for window management and screen recording
- Workspace management in Hyprland, I3, and Sway
- Pipewire for audio controls
- Pam for authentication and building lockscreens
- Greetd for building a display manager
- UPower for monitoring battery statistics
- Power Profiles Daemon
- MPRIS compatible media players
- StatusNotifierItem compatible system tray clients

title: "Distributing Configurations"

If you plan to distribute your configuration to a lot of users, you should keep
a couple things in mind:

### API Breaks
Quickshell will have API breaks in future versions.
You should have a way to track specific revisions with your distribution
to avoid breakage if a user updates quickshell before you can update your configuration.

With Nix this should be as simple as tracking a specific revision.
For Arch, and other distributions without a mechanism to do this, you may
want to include a package that builds a specific Quickshell revision with
your configuration.

### Configuration Paths
Quickshell can load configurations from a number of different paths.
The ideal path depends on how you distribute your config.

#### As dotfiles
If you distribute your config as a set of dotfiles, you should place
the config in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/quickshell/<name>` (usually `~/.config/quickshell/<name>`).
Named configurations can be used in the quickshell command by specifying `--config` or `-c`
(`qs -c <name>`).

You should not use the bare `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/quickshell` directory as that will
make it harder for users to have any other configuration.

#### As a package
Some configurations are distributed as distro packages. These packages should use a
path in `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`, usually `/etc/xdg` for their files.

As with dotfiles, named configurations should be used (`$CONFIG_DIR/quickshell/<name>`).
